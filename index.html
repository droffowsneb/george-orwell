          <h2>Latest Book Release: <em>Nineteen Eighty-Four</em></h2>
          <img src="images/1984-thumb.jpeg" alt="1984 book cover thumbnail" class="img-thumbnail rounded float-left releaseThumb">
          <p>When 1984 was first published, it was regarded as the imaginary description of a dystopian society of the future. Now many people believe that this society belongs to the past, claiming that our current situation is even worse. No matter what one’s personal beliefs may be on the subject, this novel is undoubtedly one of the greatest of the previous century. Within the framework of the totalitarian regime of the Big Brother, everyone and everything is being watched and recorded at all times via countless interactive televisions. Everything has to be adjusted according to the one and only truth, the one propagated by the Party and its only true representative mechanism, the Big Brother, who has complete control over everyone’s actions and consciousness. The ultimate crime is the crime of thought – freedom, language and feelings have to disappear, anyone who resists is sentenced to death. This political manifesto against any and all totalitarian systems has been translated into 65 languages and has sold millions of copies. ‘Big Brother’, the ‘Newspeak‘ and ‘Doublethink’ are unique conceptions of a wonderful mind that history will remember.
          </p>
          <p>The effect of Nineteen Eighty-Four on the English language is extensive; the concepts of Big Brother, Room 101, the Thought Police, thoughtcrime, unperson, memory hole (oblivion), doublethink (simultaneously holding and believing contradictory beliefs) and Newspeak (ideological language) have become common phrases for denoting totalitarian authority. Doublespeak and groupthink are both deliberate elaborations of doublethink, and the adjective "Orwellian" means similar to Orwell's writings, especially Nineteen Eighty-Four. The practice of ending words with "-speak" (such as mediaspeak) is drawn from the novel. Orwell is perpetually associated with 1984; in July 1984, an asteroid was discovered by Antonín Mrkos and named after Orwell.

            <div>
              <p class="accordionText">
              In 1928 the young author of this book was not called “George Orwell” yet (literary pseydonum), but Eric Blair. He wrote this book many years before the Animal Farm and 1984 became famous on a global scale, with a unique aura of literary talent, humor and remarkably realistic descriptions of his experiences in the metropoleis of Europe, Paris and London. The author faces hunger, cruel conditions, neglect and indifference on the streets and in the dorms of the homeless.

            <div>
              <p class="accordionText">
              Gordon Cosmstock, the hero of this Orwellian novel published in 1936, struggles against the capitalist structure of the British society during the Interwar Period. Gordon quits his job in an advertising company, rejects the beliefs of his society and concentrates on writing a book. He lives on the margins of society, not accepting the value of money and the organization of the society. This is one of many Orwellian works where the central character is damaged after his conflict with the dominant system.

            <h3>Homage to Catalonia (1938)</h3>
            <div>
              <p class="accordionText">
              Orwell’s involvement in the Spanish Civil War in 1936, writing reports for British newspapers, did not happen exclusively within the framework of the journalist’s identity, but evolved into a real, active participation, where he took up arms and stood at the front line in support of his own ideals and the common struggle of the Spanish people against Franco’s fascism.

            <h3>Animal Farm (1945)</h3>
            <div>
              <p class="accordionText">
              Animal Farm is a unique Orwellian allegory of Stalinism and any totalitarian system. George Orwell was a fervent supporter of socialism, namely anarcho-syndicalism, as well as Trotskyism. The cruelties he experienced during the Spanish Civil War (1936), the violent suppression of the anarchists of Catalonia by the Spanish communists supported by the Soviet Union and Stalinism.
